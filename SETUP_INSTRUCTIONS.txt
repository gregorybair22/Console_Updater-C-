Visual Studio Startup Project Setup
====================================

To fix the "Class Library cannot be started" error:

1. In Visual Studio, open Solution Explorer (View → Solution Explorer)
2. Right-click on "Updater.Cli" project
3. Select "Set as Startup Project"

Now you can run/debug the console application directly from Visual Studio.

Alternatively:
